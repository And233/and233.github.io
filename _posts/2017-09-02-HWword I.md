# 家园  武器及HWC历史

## Ion cannon 离子炮

The Ion Cannon is one of the more powerful weapons to be seen in Homeworld. Through the use of an accelerated particle beam, the ion cannon is capable of penetrating even the toughest of Capital Ship armor. Its firepower is matched only by the Heavy Missile, an anti-capital ship weapon developed by the Vaygr, and exceeded by the Phased Cannon Array.

离子炮是HW系列中最强力的武器之一。通过一束经过加速后的粒子束，离子炮可以击穿哪怕是最厚实的主力舰装甲。这一武器的火力只有维格尔开发的反主力舰武器——重型导弹能与之媲美，也只有先祖相位加农炮阵列可以真正超越它。

The ion cannon itself is believed to have been first used by the Bentusi, and then traded to the Kushan people in the Great Wastelands. The Taiidan received no such Bentusi assistance and acquired the weapon through their own research.

离子炮本身据传是由本图西第一个使用，后来在大荒之地时卖给了库申人。泰坦人没有这样收到过本图西的援助，他们是靠一己之力研发出这种武器的。

While the ion cannon does tremendous damage, it comes with the price of bulkiness and high energy consumption. in fact, the weapon is so big that only Frigate vessels may mount it, even then by wrapping the hull around the length of the entire cannon. This is the case in Homeworld, where the Ion Cannon Frigates make use of this design philosophy. Because of these problems, the ion cannon is used primarily in the role of an anti capital ship weapon, though technological innovations during Homeworld: Cataclysm allowed an anti-strike craft variant of the weapon.

虽然离子炮有着惊人的威力，但它也带来了庞大笨重和高能量消耗的缺点，实际上，由于过于巨大，这种武器不能安装在护卫舰以下的舰船上，即便是护卫舰也只能设计成把装甲包在离子炮上的样子。这就是HW系列中离子炮护卫舰的普遍设计思路。由于这些缺点，离子炮主要作为反主力舰武器来使用，虽然在HWC中随着技术进步也诞生了可以反打击宇航器的型号。

* ### Ion cannons in Homeworld HW1中的离子炮

In the original game of Homeworld, ion cannons were used by the Kushan, the Taiidan, the Turanic Raiders, the Kadeshi, and the Bentusi.

在原版的HW1游戏中，离子炮由库申，泰坦，图拉尼，卡德什和本图西使用。

Both the Kushan and the Taiidan races applied ion cannon technology to their capital ships. Ion cannons were used on Kushan capital ships such as the Ion Cannon Frigate, the Destroyer and the Heavy Cruiser. As for the Taiidan, warships equipped with ion cannons include the Ion Cannon Frigate, the Destroyer and the Heavy Cruiser.

库申和泰坦都将离子炮技术运用在他们的主力舰上。离子炮技术被装备在两者的离子炮护卫舰，驱逐舰和重巡洋舰上。

While the Turanic Raiders relied heavily on the use of strike craft, they also had 2 types of capital ships using the ion cannon as the primary weapon. The Ion Array Frigate and the Attack Carrier both used ion cannons to deal damage to the enemy.

虽然图拉尼海盗们非常依赖于他们的打击宇航器的运用，但他们也拥有两种使用以离子炮作为主要武器的主力舰。离子阵列舰和攻击航母都使用离子炮来攻击敌人。

The Kadeshi showed considerable mastery over their use of ion cannon technology and may be considered to be second only to the Bentusi. Kadeshi capital ships using the ion cannon include the Kadeshi Mothership and the Multi-Beam Frigate. The latter is one of the most dangerous ship designs in Homeworld, featuring 4 full power ion cannons fitted onto a compact frigate design. In effect, the Multi-Beam Frigate's firepower is roughly equivalent to that of 4 Firelances or Sajuuk Cors.

卡德什在离子炮技术上有着相当杰出的造诣，在这方面他们可能仅次于本图西。卡德什的母舰和多光束波护卫舰等主力舰都使用了离子炮。后者堪称HW1中最危险的舰船之一，这是因其能将4门高能离子炮装进一艘设计紧凑的护卫舰这一特点所致、事实上，多光束波护卫舰的火力确实基本等同于4艘火矛级（库申离子炮舰）或萨尤克.寇级（泰坦离子炮舰）。

In Homeworld, the Bentusi Exchange is equipped with 3 rapid-fire ion cannons. These ion cannons differ from those used by the other races in that they can fire constantly without recharging, and are capable of tracking even fast-moving strike craft.

在HW1中，本图西贸易船装备了3门高射速离子炮。这种离子炮和其它种族的区别在于其能不需充能地连续射击，而且还能追踪灵活度高的打击宇航器。

* ### Ion cannons in Homeworld: Cataclysm HWC中的离子炮

During the Beast War, ion cannons were used by the Kushan, the Taiidan, the Turanic Raiders, Kiith Somtaaw and the Bentusi. Since the Homeworld War, ion cannon technology had gone through various improvements and advancements.

在异兽战争期间，离子炮由库申，泰坦，图拉尼，萨木塔基斯和本图西使用。从家园战争以来，离子炮技术有了各种各样的改进和发展。

The Somtaaw implemented ion cannon weaponry on three of their capital ships - the Multi-Beam Frigate, the Destroyer, and the Dreadnought. Of the three vessels, the Dervish is probably the best example of innovation for an already awe-inspiring weapon. By accelerating the particles within a helix bundle in the ship, the Dervish is capable of firing an ion beam from each of its 5 turrets. While the ion beams fired in this manner are considerably weaker than a standard beam, they have fast-tracking capabilities and are used primarily to deal with strike craft.

萨木塔将离子炮装在了他们的主力舰上——多光束护卫舰，驱逐舰和无畏舰。三种舰船之中，苦行僧级多光束护卫舰可能是对一种本已令人惊叹的武器进行改进的最佳诠释。通过利用舰船内的一束螺旋结构对粒子进行加速，苦行僧级可以从它的5个炮塔中分别发射一道离子束。虽然这种结构下的离子束在火力上相比普通离子束有一定的衰减，但其拥有的高速追踪能力能使其能主要用于对付打击宇航器。

During the war the Bentusi were forced to reveal their ultimate weapon - the Super Acolyte. Through the applied use of crystalline conduits in strike craft, the Bentusi were able to design a fighter equipped with two high-powered ion cannons. These ion cannons had short firing and recharge times, allowing the fighter to rapidly retarget enemy vessels. These ships were granted to the Somtaaw immediately after the destruction of the Nomad Moon, which itself used rapid-fire ion cannons developed by the Taiidan Republic.

在战争中，本图西被迫祭出了他们的终极武器——超级侍僧机。通过在打击宇航器内运用晶体导管，本图西可以设计出一种装备了两门大威力离子炮的战斗机。这种离子炮的开火和充能时间都很短，允许战斗机能快速切换目标。在游猎战星被摧毁后这种飞船立刻就被交给萨木塔建造和使用，而游猎战星本身也是使用泰坦共和国开发的高射速离子炮为主要武器。

* ### Ion cannons in Homeworld 2 HW2中的离子炮

In Homeworld 2, ion cannons are used exclusively by the Hiigaran race. For some reason, the advanced ion cannon technology developed during the Beast War is absent in this era, in spite of the fact that Homeworld 2 takes place nearly a century after the Hiigaran Landfall. (The Beast War was about 15 years after the Landfall.)

在HW2中，离子炮是希格拉的专属武器。出于某些原因，在异兽战争期间开发出的先进离子炮技术在HW2的时代并没有多少尚存了。虽然HW2的时代距离希格拉回归已经过了几乎一个世纪了（异兽战争则是于回归后第15年时爆发的）。

The ion cannon is present in three of the Hiigaran fleet's units - the Hiigaran Ion Platform, the Ion Cannon Frigate and the Battlecruiser.

在希格拉舰队里离子炮技术主要由三种单位使用——希格拉离子平台，离子炮护卫舰和战列巡洋舰。

It is believed that ion cannons in Homeworld 2 are available in three classes - light, medium, and heavy. This hypothesis came about because those three units possessed differing firepower regardless of the number of ion cannons they were equipped with. The light ion cannon used in the Ion Platform deals so little damage that a platform must mount 4 of the cannons in order for it to be a viable anti-frigate unit. The Ion Cannon Frigate probably uses the medium variant of the weapon as its one beam is capable of equaling and even exceeding the damage potential of the Ion Platform. On the top of the line is the heavy ion cannon which is mounted on the dual cannon turrets of the Battlecruiser. The heavy ion cannon is so powerful that a single salvo involving 4 beams can easily destroy an un-upgraded carrier.

可以相信，在HW2里离子炮分为3个级别——轻，中和重型。这一理论主要是源于无论装备了多少门离子炮，这三种单位的火力都有区别。在离子平台上使用的轻型离子炮所能造成的伤害低到一个平台必须搭载四门离子炮才能成为一个合格的反护卫舰单位。离子炮护卫舰则可能使用了中型的版本，因为它只用一门离子炮就能达到甚至超越离子平台的最大伤害能力。最高级的重型离子炮则是战列巡洋舰上的双发离子炮塔。这种重型离子炮的威力大到只需一次四发离子束齐射就能轻松摧毁一艘未升级的航母。

It is interesting to note that while the Hiigarans are able to squeeze 4 ion cannons onto a single Ion Platform in Homeworld 2, they can only mount a single cannon onto a frigate hull as seen from the Ion Cannon Frigate, successor to the original Firelance-class. Of course, this can probably be attributed to the varying damage potentials allowed by each ion cannon variant.

有一个有趣的事实是，在HW2里虽然希格拉可以把四门离子炮挤进一个离子平台中，但他们还是只能在作为火矛级离子炮舰继承者的新型离子炮护卫舰上装一门离子炮。当然，这一问题也可以归于由不同离子炮型号所带来的不同火力所致。

## Pulsar Beam 脉冲波束

The Pulsar Beam is an anti-corvette and anti-frigate beam weapon. Pulsars are miniature short-wave ion cannons created by Hiigaran scientists, and possibly reverse-engineered from the Super Acolyte. They fire an Ion beam with an extremely short duration at a relatively high rate of fire (about 1 shot each second). This high fire rate and good damage make them the Hiigaran Navy's weapon of choice against corvettes. They are the primary weapon of Pulsar Gunships, and are also used on Battlecruisers as a flexible point-defense weapon.

脉冲波束是一种反护航艇和护卫舰的光束武器。脉冲炮是一种发射短促光波的微缩版离子炮，由希格拉科学家发明，也有可能是通过对超级侍僧机进行逆向工程的结果。它们以相对较高的射速（每秒大概一发）发射持续时间极短的离子束。这种高射速和不错的伤害使得这一武器成为希格拉海军反护航艇的首选武器。脉冲炮是脉冲炮艇的主要武器，也用在战列巡洋舰上作为一种灵活的点防御武器。

## Laser 激光

The Laser was a beam weapons system used by the Vaygr; compared to the Hiigarans' Ion Cannon, it fired in smaller, red pulses instead of a continuous beam. Mainly an anti-strike craft/frigate weapon, the Laser was mounted on both the Laser Corvette and the Battlecruiser: the former as an anti-frigate weapon, and the latter as a point-defense anti-fighter system.

激光是一种由维格尔使用的光束武器系统；与希格拉的离子炮相比，它发射的是一种细小的红色脉冲激光束而非持续不断的离子束。激光武器装备在激光艇和战列巡洋舰上，主要作为反打击宇航器/护卫舰武器使用：激光艇将其用作反战机的主要武器，而战巡则将其用于反战机的点防御武器系统。

## Plasma Bomb 等离子炸弹

The Plasma Bomb is an anti-Capital Ship weapon generally found on Attack Bombers and Assault Frigates in the Kushan and Taiidan fleets. The technology would later be found on Vaygr and Hiigaran fleets. They appear as blue energy bolts and leave behind clouds of ionized plasma on impact.

等离子炸弹是一种被库申和泰坦舰队的攻击轰炸机和突袭舰广泛使用的反主力舰武器。这种技术后来也能在维格尔和希格拉舰队中找到。这种炸弹外表上看是蓝色的能量弹，在击中目标时会留下电离等离子云。

Plasma bombs are condensed packages of engine exhaust, channeled into the launcher unit and held together by a magnetic bottle. Upon launch, the magnetic containment is projected outward towards the target. The hot volatile plasma is especially effective against the heavy armor found on Capital Ships and frigates, but can also deal great damage to strike craft (if they slow down or stops), especially corvettes.

等离子炸弹是经过高度压缩后的引擎废料，在被引入发射器单元后进入一个等离子磁瓶内聚集成型。发射时，等离子容器就会被抛射出膛，飞向目标。这团不稳定的高热等离子在对付主力舰和护卫舰的厚重装甲时有特别客观的效果。不过在对付打击宇航器（如果它们的速度够慢甚至停止的话）时也会造成大量伤害，对于护航艇更是如此。

The two largest drawbacks of the plasma bomb are the low range, a result of the plasma's magnetic containment disintegrating, and the slow speed at which the bombs travel, which make it inefficient against maneuverable strike craft.

等离子炸弹的两个最大的缺陷分别是射程太短（这是由于等离子的磁容器会很快因等离子的热量而瓦解所致）和炸弹过低的飞行速度，这使其难以有效对抗机动性高的打击宇航器。

## Flechette Cannon 针弹炮

Flechette Cannons are kinetic weapons used commonly by the Vaygr.

针弹炮是维格尔常用的动能武器。

Each Flechette Cannon fires thin, long projectiles, silver in colour, which used their kinetic energy to penetrate through a target's armour Source: Homeworld 2 Manual page 59 . When fired the projectiles are accelerated to very high speeds which give them enough energy to blast even through destroyer hulls.

每一门针弹炮都发射一种银色的细长形炮弹，这种炮弹利用发射时产生的动能来穿透目标的装甲（来源：HW2手册第59页）。当开火时，炮弹会被加速到极高的速度，这甚至带给它们足够的动能来击穿驱逐舰的装甲。

Flechette Cannons were commonly used amongst Vaygr units. The smallest variant was used on the Vaygr Scouts, and wasn't very harmful. The largest one was the secondary weapon of a Destroyer - two heavy turrets were capable of firing almost 360 degrees around the ship, being a powerful weapon against frigates and against corvette class ships. However they could not track and hit small, agile targets such as Strike Craft with ease.

针弹炮广泛运用于各个维格尔单位之间。这种炮的最小的型号被用在维格尔侦察机上，且并没有太大威力。最大的型号则作为驱逐舰的副武器——两个火力覆盖面几乎能围绕全船达到360度的重炮塔，是反护卫舰和护航艇级舰船的有力武器。但是它们很难追踪和击中例如打击宇航器这类小而灵活的目标。

### Trivia 趣闻

The word flechette can be translated from French to English as "little arrow", or dart projectile.

Flechette一词从法语译为英语后是“小箭”或针状物的意思。
